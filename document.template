\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

\begin{figure}

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to role_diagram.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy role_diagram.xml,
% you must remove role_diagram.pdf from SOURCES in the Makefile.

Fig.~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the
IVOA architecture \citep{2021ivoa.spec.1101D}.
