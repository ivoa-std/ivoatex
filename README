ivoatex Version 0.4
===================

This is another attempt at a generalised authoring system for IVOA
(http://www.ivoa.net) documents with the design goals of

 * version-controlled (or at least controllable) source file(s)
 * reasonable-quality PDF and HTML output
 * low to moderate installation effort (on POSIX systems with LaTeX)
 * support with routine drudgery.


Documentation
=============

Documentation on ivoatex, including a chapter on a quick start, is 
given in the IVOA note "The IVOATeX Document Preparation System",
available at http://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATex/index.html.



If you have the dependencies together (essentially, a GNU build
toolchain, a texlive-equivalent TeX distribution, subversion, and
xsltproc; on the average linux machines, chances are you're almost
there), you can build this note (which is written in IVOATeX itself)
like this::

	svn co https://volute.g-vo.org/svn/trunk/projects/ivoapub/ivoatexDoc
	cd ivoatexDoc
	make biblio
	make

Then start your favourite PDF viewer on ivoatexDoc.pdf.


Trouble?
========

In case of ivoatex-related issues, contact gavo@ari.uni-heidelberg.de.


Acknowledgements
================

The immediate predecessor of this is the document generation system created
by Mark Taylor for SAMP and VOTable; essentially, this is a generalisation
of Mark's work.  This, in turn, built on work done by Sebastien Derriere.

Another inspiration was Paul Harrison's ivoadoc system; in particular,
parts of the XSL style sheet were taken from there, as well as the idea of
using svn:externals.

The document generation from XML schema files was adapted from XSLT 
stylesheets written by Ray Plante.
