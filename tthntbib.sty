% Very simplified natbib macros for ivoatex and tth.
% 
% This is for use with tth exclusively.
%
% We do not support multiple citations in one cite, any customisation,
% etc -- just plain author (year) and (author, year); also the
% three-argument forms are not supported.  Contributions are welcome.
% 
% Since the tth braces don't work for us at all, we just turn them off
% entirely and manage them ourselves.
