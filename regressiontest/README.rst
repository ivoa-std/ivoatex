=======================
ivoaTeX Regression Test
=======================

To give the maintainers of ivoaTeX_ a bit more confidence when doing
changes, this is a regression test that goes through the motions of
starting a document and building it, exercising as many of the features
mentioned in ivoatexDoc as I can.

See the docstring in run-regression.py on how to add to the tests.
