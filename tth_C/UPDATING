tth is maintained by Ian Hutchinson, who occasionally releases new versions,
which usually fix some bugs or contain some improvements.  To update
this, pull "C code for any platform" from

http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/tth-noncom/download.html

then go into this directory and say

tar --strip-components=1 -xvzf <path-to-your-download>/tth_C.tgz

This assumes GNU tar.

The actual (lex) source is at <svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/tth/code>.

Note 2023-06: For a while we will diverge from upstream tth by removing
all support for German TeX sequences (with u+0022 as active character: "a,
"s, "`, etc) from tth.  This needs to be done on the source from
sourceforge.  A patch for that is in no-german.patch.

While we need this, the procedure to update our tth is:

	Get the latest tarball from
		https://sourceforge.net/projects/tth/files/ and untar it.
		WARNING: the svn on sourceforge is outdated.  Do not use
		it.

	cd tth
	cp <path-to-ivoatex>/tth_C/no-german.patch .
	patch < no-german.patch
	make tth.c
	cp tth.c <path-to-ivoatex>/tth_C/

(and then commit)

Note 2023-07: Upstream still has TTH_CHARLEN 500, which is trouble on
certain compilers with large bibliography items
(https://github.com/ivoa-std/ivoatex/pull/104).  *If* you put in new code
from upstream, until the relevant buffer overflows are fixed, manually bump
this to 5000.
